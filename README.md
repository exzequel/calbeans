This project was developed as the final project for our INFOMAN (Information Management) and WEBAPPS (Web Applications) courses. It served as an opportunity for us to apply the knowledge and skills gained throughout these courses to create a practical web application. The project allowed us to showcase our understanding of information management principles and the development of web-based solutions. We are grateful to our instructors for providing guidance and support throughout this project.
